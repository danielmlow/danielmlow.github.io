Daniel Low is a data scientist and mental health researcher. He is a Research Scientist (tenure-track Principal Investigator) in the DAIR Center at [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/science/) in New York City. He is also a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University.

His work leverages LLMs and causal inference to analyze text and speech data from studies on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, meditation, psychedelics, peer support, and AI chatbots. He uses data from ecological momentary assessments of hospitalized individuals, social media, qualitative interviews, and clinical trials.

He recently completed a NIMH T32 Postdoctoral Fellowship on causal inference for suicide prevention mentored by [Matthew Nock](https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/people/matthew-k-nock-phd) (Department of Psychology, Harvard University) and [Miguel Hernán](https://miguelhernan.org/about) (Department of Epidemiology, Harvard Chan School of Public Health) at the [CAUSALab](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/causalab/). He received his PhD in [Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) from Harvard University in 2024 under the supervision of [Satrajit Ghosh](https://satra.cogitatum.org/) (MIT). His dissertation focused on detecting dozens of suicide risk factors in text and speech using LLMs, speech processing, and machine learning. His prior training was in Argentina, Italy, and the Netherlands in cognitive science and natural language processing.

He has co-founded the Harvard-MIT Speech and Language Biomarker Interest Group which organizes talks and discussions in this field, and he has taught machine learning and natural language processing at Harvard and other universities.

His work has been funded by an NIH NIMH T32 training grant, a RallyPoint Fellowship, an NIH NIDCD T32 training grant, an Amelia Peabody Professional Development Award, a Harvard Psychology Research Innovation Hodgson Fund, and a Fundación Williams grant.

He aspires to leverage AI, causal inference, and first-person experiences to reduce suffering and enhance flourishing in a scalable and equitable way.

He enjoys meditation, jiu jitsu, dance, standup, and Messi.

<!-- Daniel Low is a data scientist and mental health researcher. He is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [CAUSALab](https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/) at the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, mentored by Miguel Hernán, and in the [Nock Lab](https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/), Department of Psychology at Harvard University, mentored by Matthew Nock, as part of the NIMH T32 grant on Comparative Effectiveness Research for Suicide Prevention.

He completed his PhD in [Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](https://shbtphd.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, carried out at the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/) at MIT and was advised by Satrajit Ghosh (MIT, Harvard Medical School).

His work focuses on using natural language processing and speech processing, and machine learning to predict suicidal thoughts and behaviors and understand the effects of meditation and psychedelics on mental health and affect. He is integrating these methods with psychometrics and causal inference to better measure and intervene on affect and symptoms during clinical and peer conversations. He uses data from ecological momentary assessments of hospitalized individuals, social media, psychotherapy sessions, and clinical trials.

He has co-founded the Harvard-MIT Speech and Language Biomarker Interest Group which organizes talks and discussions in this field ([request to join here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/harvard-mit-speech-group/join)). He teaches workshops and [courses](https://danielmlow.github.io/teaching/) on machine learning and natural language processing at Harvard and other universities.

His work has been funded by an NIH NIMH T32 training grant, a RallyPoint Fellowship, an NIH NIDCD T32 training grant, the NIH Common Fund Bridge2AI program, an Amelia Peabody Professional Development Award, and a Fundacion Williams grant.  -->
