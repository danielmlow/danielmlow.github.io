Here are some resources I've put together:

- Data science resources (programming, machine learning, statistics, doing research, etc) ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127Npk6Z2gV-p_ewwnRz7qDyvKKRI6vb6Yg3zKnOw16s/edit?usp=sharing))
- My checklist for a machine learning project ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xA8nz5CvB1iQaRbvFv0XRnPbkm7yYQ18lFcKmP-IFmY/edit?usp=sharing))
- Tips, resources, and scholarships for applying to Master and PhD programs ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/129lplW2mpQmIpXeRJwN4LCUG-2Qd84IUCG1plUMYbzw/edit?usp=sharing))
- My NLP, machine learning, speech processing quick and dirty tutorials ([link](https://github.com/danielmlow/tutorials/blob/main/README.md))

Feel free to leave feedback or add additional ones through comments and suggestion edits.
